Wave Assets Viewer
==================

Drop Wave Engine assets (WPK files) to easily see what these contain. That easy.

Wave Engine official site: www.waveengine.net


Ideas
-----

- Support dropping directly to the EXE, passing the file name through args
- Icon: somewhat like Wave logo but inside a wood frame (designers, you're welcome!)


Roadmap
-------

- 0.1
	- Support for Texture2D format: show its border, modify the scale, translate it, see the size

	- Support for SoundEffect: play/pause, info? (length, bitrate, etc.)
- 0.3
	- Support for TextureAtlas
- 0.4
	- Support for SpriteFont
- 0.5 (poke David √Åvila for some help here :-) )
	- Support for 3D: models, cubemaps, etc.

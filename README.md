Wave Assets Viewer
==================

Drop Wave Engine assets (WPK files) to easily see what these contain. That easy.

[Download](https://github.com/marcoscm/WaveAssetsViewer/raw/master/Releases/WaveAssetsViewer-v0.2.zip) (v0.2, current stable version)

Wave Engine official site: www.waveengine.net


Ideas
-----

- Support dropping directly to the EXE, passing the file name through args
- Icon: somewhat like Wave logo but inside a wood frame (designers, you're welcome!)
